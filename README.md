# NLP-projects
This fold contains projects related to natural language processing. Projects include movie reviews classification, hotel reviews classification, and toxic comments classification. Projects with symbol * are featured.

# Movie review sentiment classification - ML models comparison

In this project I implement some machine learning algorithms: KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Navie Bayes, Ridge Classifier, AdaBoostClassification, Random Forest. 

Fist part is text cleaning. Methods used are: POS-tagging, Lemmatizer, removing punctuation, removing symbols, regularizing negation format and so on.

Sencond part is data visualization: wordcloud

Third part is featuring engineering: TfidfVectorizer

Fourth part is fitting models: KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Navie Bayes, Ridge Classifier, AdaBoostClassification, Random Forest and ensemble method. 

Last part is model evaluation. Methods used are: Accuracy, AUC, ROC, Precision, Recall, False Positive Rate, True Rate

# Hotel reviews sentiment analysis

In this project I use random forest models to analyse hotel reviews. Main libraries used in this project include NLTK, Gensim and Scikit-learn. This will be done based on hotel reviews from Booking.com. Compared with Movie review sentiment classification project, I pay more attention on text cleaning and feature engineering.

There are four parts in this project: text preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis and model evaluation.

# Movie reviews sentiment analysis - deep learning models

This project focus on deep learning models: RNN model, Bidirectional LSTM model, and Fastext model. Dataset I used here is the same as that in Movie review sentiment classification - ML models comparison projectâ‰¥

# Toxic comments classification

This project introduces basic concepts of RNN, LSTM and BERT, and implements those models on Toxic Comment Classification Challenge data set from Kaggle competition.
